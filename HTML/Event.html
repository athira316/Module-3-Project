                Advanced preparation, whether that means having a back up caterer or finding reserve speakers 
                in case a headliner bails,  can help you avert disaster. Sometimes the unexpected happens, but the best
                #eventprofs know how to get out of a sticky situation. The next time you start planning an event,just remember
                these words from Confucius,and make sure you’re doing everything you can to be ready in order to achieve event success! 
                o you’re ready to write your wedding ceremony script. But, very likely, you’re not writing it for the wedding you envisioned. 
                Maybe you’re planning a virtual wedding (if you are, we’ve got you covered), or a socially distanced wedding, or a much 
                smaller wedding. Whatever you’re planning, in 2020 it may be a very different wedding than you imagined. (We’re so sorry.) 
                But if there is any upside to this mess of a situation, it’s that all of the focus will come down to a few meaningful details 
                (and you get to choose what those details are). But suddenly, with everything stripped away, your wedding ceremony script 
                matters a whole lot. (And your vows. If you haven’t written those, we’ve got a 2020 guide for you right here.)
                So how do you get from here to there (there being a wedding ceremony script you love). If you’re having a religious wedding, 
                your wedding ceremony script is often provided for you by your religious leader. You may be able to modify it a bit… in fact, 
                in 2020, you may have to modify it a bit, depending on the realities of your wedding. But if you’re having a secular wedding, 
                you’ll probably find that you’re going to need to come up with a wedding ceremony script on your own.</text></H3>

            <p><H3>My birthday is my favourite day of the entire year. Not because of the presents or the cake or the decorations, 
                but rather because of the special attention and love I get from my close friends and family. The thought of being 
                a year older is always surreal and exciting. I don’t normally like to have birthday parties, but my small surprise 
                birthday party last year was unique and very special.Some people wouldn’t really define it as a party, because 
                I didn’t have lots of guests and I didn’t play party games. It was my first week at university, and to celebrate my 
                birthday, my friends wished me at 12 AM and gave me plenty of hugs. We decided to watch a movie of my choice, so 
                I chose a horror movie. We ate lots of food, chatted and listened to music, which made for a nice, small party.
                Later in the day, I went to see my family, who surprised me with the prettiest birthday cake I’d ever seen. The edge 
                of the cake was completely made of Kit Kat’s, and the top was sprinkled with M&Ms. I blew the candles, cut the cake 
                and cheered as I opened birthday presents. I played around with my younger siblings and watched a movie with them.
                I think the reason this birthday party of sorts is memorable for me is because it was my first week in a new place. 
                I was very frightened and nervous, but spending time with friends and family because of my birthday helped me feel 
                more comfortable. During the birthday party, the birthday person has to thank everyone for coming and take the lead 
                role in gathering people for games or whatever events are planned. The main event of a birthday party is the cake 
                cutting while all the guests sing the birthday song and feed the birthday person. After the cake cutting, the guests 
                eat the meals provided along with their share of the birthday cake. At the end, all the guests leave and the birthday 
                person begins opening their presents.</H3>

            <p><H3>A family reunion is traditionally a time when a family as a whole comes together and enjoys the company of one another. I don't 
                think that my family believes in coming together as a whole because every time that we have a family reunion or another event 
                similar to it, my family automatically breaks up into three different groups. Those groups are the gossipers, the sports critics, 
                and the game players. Every time we come together these same three groups are always formed, and end up doing the same thing.
                The gossipers are the main group at the reunion. They are comprised of all the females in the family who are over 25 which is all 
                of my aunts, my mother and a few of my older cousins. As can be told from the title of this group, the only thing that occurs is 
                gossiping. They will gossip about family members who are not present at the reunion, and even, occasionally, about a family member
                who is present at the reunion. Once can always tell when they are talking about someone at the reunion by the way that they pipe down 
                to a whisper and begin to huddle together.The second group, usually the smallest group, are the sports talkers. This group is usually 
                all male and the age range is usually 18 and older. I very often find myself in this group because of my passion for sports and because 
                I am an athlete myself. This group is usually the loudest because of the heated debates that take place between the Redskins, Ravens and Cowboy 
                fans in the family to try to prove whose team is the best. Although the main thing that takes place within this group are sports debates, 
                gossiping also occurs occasionally. Whenever most of the women leave the area, all of my uncles in the group begin to talk about how much their 
                wives drive them crazy and begin to list all of the stupid things that their wives do. As soon as the females return to the area, the gossiping 
                ends and the sports debates continue.The final group which makes up my family and firends...</H3>

            <p><H3>An award ceremony speech is a type of public performance that is claimed on the occasion of a rewarding ceremony. Depending on the event 
                and the type of acknowledgment, the content of the speech may vary from showing appreciation for the award simply saying, “I’m happy to 
                hold this award in my hands” to giving thanks to all who have contributed to gaining a particular award. Meanwhile, it definitely encompasses 
                the following components: an introduction that must be short, obvious, and positive, the main body that may involve dedications and commemorations, 
                as well as award acceptances, and a short conclusion.Ultimately, all successful award ceremony speeches have one important thing in common: they 
                regard the event from the triumphant perspective, and the best ones are prepared ahead of time. So wondering, “How to make my award ceremony speech 
                stand out?” Follow our guide where you’ll find some useful tips on the issue. Before you start reading this article and applying all the tips presented 
                in it, look at the introductory part of an award ceremony speech presented below crafted for a ‘Teacher of the Year Awards’ ceremony.
                All the finalists being here were selected during the strict tentative rounds grounded on a range of all-around evaluation criteria. 
                Regardless of their majors and spheres of interests, these individuals have something essential in common – they love their job and do their 
                best to serve the society, and thus these teachers are truly the role models for the young generation. Our thankfulness goes to all teachers for 
                their strong efforts and support in promoting the complex personal development of the young people here, in preparing them for a future career, 
                and mostly, in upbringing their young personalities with a faithful mind and open heart.</H3>

        <p><H3>On the final day we all began to dress up as soon as we reached school at 8 a.m. The function was to start sharp at 10 a.m. The school entrance 
            had been beautifully decorated with flowers and a gleaming banner. A flower-bedecked path lead up to the assembly hall where the function was to 
            be held. As the parents took their seats, the teachers went about making last-minute checks and adjustments. Besides, some short plays, the students 
            had prepared a variety of songs and dances.The first item was put up by the junior-most class. Dressed as flowers and butterflies they showcased the 
            advantage of nature’s beauty. As the butterflies flitted around the stage two children got their wings entangled. In trying to separate, one of the 
            wings came away. Much to the amusement of all the two children started blaming each other, blissfully unaware of the audience. Everyone was in splits of 
            laughter till some teachers came and rescued the act. Next came the group songs and folk dances. Dressed in colorful skirts, the whirling dancers were a 
            sight to watch. The class V students had prepared a Hindi play from Panchatantra. Everything went smoothly till the angry tiger tripped and fell while 
            chasing the fox. Instead of roaring with anger, the student playing the tiger began crying aloud.Fortunately, he was not hurt and began laughing when 
            the fox dropped his mustache. This child, being smart, picked it up and put it in his pocket. The audience roared with laughter, but everyone loved the 
            children. The last act was the play about a man who had lost his memory. The senior students turned out be excellent actors and their efforts were met 
            with well-deserved applause. As the curtains came down, everyone was requested to go to the grounds for refreshments.</H3>

        <p><H3>About fifteen years ago a culture was born. In Europe a new type of music was being created. Something new, something fresh. A music fueled by 
            throbbing beats over rattling bass. This is electronic music. The mastermind behind this whole up and coming culture was and is the DJ. In the 
            past five years have become more and more popular everyday. Some people who are not aware of this music or this culture might argue that being 
            a DJ is not a serious profession for various reasons. Throughout this paper I will prove these notions false. As support I will provide the history 
            of the DJ, what exactly it is, insight from various DJ's and much more. It all began about fifteen years ago. In towns in Europe people started…show 
            more content…There started to be more and more electronic artists surfacing everyday. The technology increased very fast every year more new equipment 
            allowed new creative boundaries to be broken. Soon the DJ slowly started to become more of the focal point of these "raves". DJ's started to be the 
            attractions of these raves instead of just a place to have fun. The DJ's started to make names for themselves along with this came different styles of 
            DJing. One of the first styles of electronic music created was house music. This music quickly moved into nightclubs and raves. Soon thereafter many 
            different styles of electronic music were born. Such as, break beat, drum and bass, hard house, trance, progressive trance, big beat, and happy 
            hardcore(www.clubdance.com). DJ's started to specialize in certain types of electronic music. Some started to consider themselves not just as DJ's 
            but also artists. The music became more about expression and unity. In a recent documentary drum and bass artist Roni Size says(Better Living Through 
            Circuitry) " When I step behind the tables at a party it's more than just playing tracks for a group of people. It's like my goal to take these people 
            to a place they have not been before. To create a mix that is so unique and intense that takes the audience and puts them all into a new place together. 
            It's an art form!" As you can see by this statement these DJ's take their jobs seriously. Soon DJ's started to not only put out many</H3>
