    <h2><font color="navy">ABOUT US</font></h2>
    Event management system is used to manage all the activity related to event.
    In any event many service providers work simultaneously and it is very hard
    to manage these providers.
    It is also important for event organizer that he has all the contacts
    details of these service providers
    so that he can contact them any time to plan an event at given time.
    To manage all these activity we have developed this software. 
    To get success in the event management business, user should have 
    strong network contacts of service provider. 
    These contacts are essentially providers of specific services who can 
    be mobilized quickly to participate in any given event. 
    To make an event successful event manager needs different service 
    provider like Sound systems services, Lighting providers, 
    Canteen services, stage construction and so on. 
    In present system Event Company has to do all management work manually. 
    They keep all payment information on papers. 
    There is no system to check the past expenses on any event.
    To do this they have to check payment register and this task is very 
    time consuming and tiresome. 
    Keeping this entire problem in mind we have developed this system. 
    This system helps the event management company to manage their paper 
    work online and, they can also retrieve report of last event they have completed.
